# those are not the droids you are looking for...

Most probably, if you you are looking for a way to build vmods with [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), you want [vmod-rs-template](https://github.com/gquintard/vmod-rs-template).

However, if you are into archeology and want an example on how you could build a toy vmod in rust for varnish 4.1 (long deprecated now), you can look at [vmod-pupa](https://github.com/gquintard/libvmod-pupa), which was written to support this [article](https://info.varnish-software.com/blog/writing-vmods-in-rust).
